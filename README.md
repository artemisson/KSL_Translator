-The program was coded purely in python.
-Make sure to extract the contents of KSL_Data.rar in the main file first before running anything.

-Install all the following dependencies in order for the code to run : 
      Python 3.10.6 
      scikit-learn 
      matplotlib 
      opencv-python 
      holistics 
      virtualenv 
      mp 
      mediapipe 
      keras 
      keras.util 
      keras.utilities 
      keras.models 
      keras layers 
      keras callbacks 
      tensorflow  
      categorical 

- NOTE : The code will not run without compiling the model using py file no.6 and without installing all required dependencies and don't change file directories after               unziping the folder.
- After Installing required dependencies, you'll have to run py file 6 to compile the LSTM Model, be sure to check categorical accuracy achieved to be 90% or higher.
- Then run py file 7 to run the prediction code where you'll be able to perform real time translation.
- Py file no 4 is for collection, pre-processing and extraction of KSL data which would be used by the model, it can be used to add more KSL signs to the model wherby you    will have to record 30 frames of a single sign, for every sign specified.
- After adding or redefining signs using py file 4, run 6 followed by 7 just as specified above.
